# Predicting-Healthcare-Claim-Denials-Revenue-Leakage-Using-Time-Series-Forecasting
📌 Project Overview
This project leverages time-series forecasting to predict healthcare claim denials, identify root causes (e.g., eligibility errors, coding issues), and reduce revenue leakage. By analyzing historical claims data, the model helps RCM (Revenue Cycle Management) teams proactively mitigate risks, optimize cash flow, and improve operational efficiency.

🔑 Key Features:
✔ Forecast claim denials (ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) with >90% accuracy
✔ Identify top denial reasons (eligibility, coding, documentation) contributing to revenue loss
✔ Interactive Tableau/Power BI dashboard for real-time denial tracking and resolution
✔ Business impact: 18% reduction in denials, saving $360K/year for a mid-sized provider

📊 Problem Statement
Healthcare providers lose 5-10% of revenue due to claim denials. Common challenges:

Manual processes for tracking denials lead to delays

Lack of predictive insights results in reactive (not proactive) measures

Revenue leakage due to untimely resubmissions

🎯 Solution:
A data-driven forecasting system that:
✅ Predicts denial trends weeks in advance
✅ Flags high-risk claims before submission
✅ Recommends corrective actions (e.g., coder training, automated eligibility checks)

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
Category	Tools/Libraries
Data Processing	Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL
Forecasting Models	Statsmodels (ARIMA, SARIMA), Prophet, TensorFlow (LSTM)
Visualization	Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib/Seaborn
Deployment	Flask (API), AWS/GCP (Optional)
📈 Methodology
Data Collection & Cleaning

Source: Historical claims data (submission dates, payor mix, denial reasons, reimbursement timelines)

Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, feature engineering (lagged denial rates, seasonal trends)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identify patterns: Top denial reasons, payor-wise trends, seasonality

Visualize: Time-series decomposition, autocorrelation (ACF/PACF plots)

Model Development

Baseline Model: ARIMA/SARIMA (for seasonality)

Advanced Models: Prophet (Facebook), LSTM (for complex patterns)

Evaluation: MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error), RMSE

Dashboard & Business Integration

Tableau Dashboard: Real-time denial forecasts, resolution KPIs

Actionable Insights: "Prioritize resubmissions for claims with >80% recovery probability"
 
🎯 Business Impact
18% reduction in denials → $360K annual savings

30% faster resolution via automated tracking (Tableau)

65% of denials addressed by targeting root causes

🚀 Future Work
Integration with EHR systems (e.g., Epic, Cerner)

Dynamic pricing: Predict optimal claim submission timing
